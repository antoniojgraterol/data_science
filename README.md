This analysis aims to thoroughly explore a job postings dataset to identify patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent or deceptive job ads. By examining a variety of variables including location, salary, company profile, and job requirements, we seek to understand which elements can predict the authenticity of a job posting.

Classification algorithms were implemented to predict the likelihood of a job posting being fraudulent. These machine learning algorithms were trained using a labeled dataset containing both fraudulent and non-fraudulent job postings. The goal is to leverage the rich information present in the dataset to build a robust and accurate model.

In summary, this analysis aims not only to understand the factors surrounding fraudulent job postings but also to implement practical and predictive solutions for improving early detection and prevention of dishonest hiring practices.
